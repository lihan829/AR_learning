Two of the rules apply right-to-left while the third applies left-to-right, making it difficult for both rule- and constraint-based formalisms to account for the interaction in a unified way. In the computational framework advocated for in this paper, the apparent difference in directionality of the three rules amounts to a subtle difference in computational classification: the left-to-right rule has the property of input strict locality (ISL) while the right-to-left rules share the property of output strict locality (OSL). However, the fact that the direction of rules with the ISL property doesn’t actually matter, a unified account becomes possible in that all three rules can be modeled as a single input-output strictly local function.},

The results of our survey add to our understanding of the typology of tone patterns and the role of ARs in two key ways. First, they indicate that both input and output locality play a role in a comprehensive theory of tone. Second, they reveal the various mechanisms by which ARs render long-distance patterns local by disentangling the various properties these representations combine. The larger contribution then is a more detailed and nuanced exploration of the interaction of representation, locality, and computational complexity in the domain of tonal phonology.},

The proposed learner is simple, efficient, and provably correct, and does not require an a priori notion of tier or projection (contra the model in Hayes and Wilson 2008); nor does it rely on the additional structure provided by Optimality Theory grammars (Prince and Smolensky 1993, 2004) or grammars in the principles-and-parameters framework (Chomsky 1981, Dresher and Kaye 1990, Gibson and Wexler 1994). Not only does the noncounting nature of nonlocal dependencies automatically follow from the way the learner generalizes, it also explains the absence of blocking patterns from the typology. Finally, the learner lends support to the idea that long-distance phonotactic patterns are phenomenologically distinct from spreading patterns, contra the hypothesis of Strict Locality (Gafos 1999, et seq.).},

It is anticipated that future research will reveal equally powerful laws applicable to non-string-based representations. Finally, this chapter argues that these laws arise as a natural consequence of how humans generalize from data.},

UNBOUNDED CIRCUMAMBIENT PROCESSES, phonological processes in which triggers or blockers appear unboundedly far away on both sides of a target, are common in tone but rare in segmental phonology. The evidence for this is based around attestations of Unbounded Tone Plateauing (UTP; Hyman 2011, Odden \& Kisseberth 2003), but it is also shown how the ‘sour grapes’ harmony pathology (Bakovic´ 2000) is unbounded circumambient. The paper argues that such processes are not WEAKLY DETERMINISTIC, which contrasts with previous typological work ﬁnding segmental phonology to be at most weakly deterministic. Positing that weak determinism bounds segmental phonology but not tonal phonology thus captures the typological asymmetry. It is also discussed why this explanation is superior to any offered by Optimality Theory.},

First, this notion of locality provides for an explicit theory of tonal well-formedness that is superior to previous explanations in that it makes clear, restrictive typological predictions. Second, it provides a clear path for understanding how these patterns can be learned. A brief survey of major tone-association patterns shows that association generalisations which are edge-based (Mende and Hausa), quality-specific (Kukuya) or positional (Northern Karanga Shona) are all local in this way. This is contrasted with previous explanations of the typology, which require global reference to the directionality of association, and can thus overgenerate.},

First, the current study demonstrates that the models do not differ in their empirical coverage of assimilatory tone-sandhi processes in Chinese dialects, contrary to previous claims. Second, the models are shown to be bi-interpretable (using a more restrictive definition of bi-interpretability than earlier studies), thus providing a formally rigorous demonstration that the differences between the structures of the models are superficial, rather than substantive. The computational characterisation pursued here is well suited to questions of notational equivalence, because it allows for a principled comparison of the empirical coverage and structural content of two models using a single formalism.},

However, output–output correspondence and ‘intercandidate’ sympathy are revealed to be problematic: it is unclear that any reasonable class of structures can reconstruct their proponents' intentions. But our contribution is positive. Proponents of both output–output correspondence and sympathy have offered alternatives that fit into the general OT picture. We show how to state these in a reasonable extension of our formalism. The problematic constraint types were developed to deal with opaque phenomena. We hope to shed new light on the debate about how to handle opacity, by subjecting some common responses to it within OT to critical investigation.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the characterization and learning of grammars defined with enriched representational models. Model-theoretic approaches to formal language theory traditionally assume that each position in a string belongs to exactly one unary relation. We consider unconventional string models where positions can have multiple, shared properties, which are arguably useful in many applications. We show the structures given by these models are partially ordered, and present a learning algorithm that exploits this ordering relation to effectively prune the hypothesis space. We prove this learning algorithm, which takes positive examples as input, finds the most general grammar which covers the data.},
